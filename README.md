A Radix tree(Trie) is a data structure used for efficiently storing and retrieving strings, often used in applications like autocomplete, spell-checking, and IP routing. It organizes keys by breaking them into smaller parts, with each character representing a branch in the tree. A Radix tree eliminates redundant nodes, making it memory-efficient for handling large dictionaries of words or patterns. Insertion and search operations are fast, with complexity depending on the length of the key rather than the number of keys stored. This makes Tries particularly suitable for tasks involving prefix matching and string manipulation.
